# ClipR: Video Compression Made Easy

**ClipR** is a straightforward batch script that compresses videos to meet Discord's size limit of 8 MB. 

Simply drag and drop your MP4 or supported video files onto the script, and it will automatically reduce their size for easy sharing. ClipR uses FFmpeg for compression and provides basic information about the input and output files during the process.
